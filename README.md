This repository contains tools for two databases maintained by [iTEM](https://transportenergy.org), the **International Transport Energy Modeling** consortium:

1. A *historical database* to form a common, public, “best available” baseline for model calibration and projections.
   The historical database is under continuous development.

2. A *model database* of transport energy projections assembled as part of the iTEM model intercomparison projects (MIPs) linked to [iTEM workshops](https://transportenergy.org/workshops/).
   To meet the intellectual property concerns of workshop participants, the model database is currently not public, and only available on request; however, the tools used to prepare it are public.
   These tools are developed periodically, during sequential MIPs.

For details on installation, usage, contributing, etc., see the **online documentation** at https://transportenergy.readthedocs.io, automatically built from the contents of this repository.
