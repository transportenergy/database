International Transport Energy Modeling (iTEM) toolkit
******************************************************

`iTEM`_ maintains two databases:

1. A **historical database** to form a common, public, “best available” baseline for model calibration and projections.
   The historical database is under continuous development.

2. A **model database** of transport energy projections assembled as part of the iTEM model intercomparison projects (MIPs) linked to `iTEM workshops`_.
   To meet the intellectual property concerns of workshop participants, the model database is currently not public, and only available on request; however, the tools used to prepare it are public.
   These tools are developed periodically, during sequential MIPs.

This documentation, built automatically from the `transportenergy/database GitHub repository <https://github.com/transportenergy/database>`_, describes the Python and R code for maintaining these databases.

Goals
=====

The goals for these tools are that:

- iTEM participants use the tools to *access* either database and perform basic
  data manipulations such as retrieval, selection, and aggregation, in either
  Python, R (or possibly, in the future, other languages).
- Members of the `iTEM organizing group`_ use the tools to prepare templates
  for data submission, and to aggregate & clean submitted data.
- iTEM participants, if they choose, maintain code that *transparently &
  reproducibly* derives the iTEM variables from immediate output files of their
  models.
- The tools are well-tested and yield reproducible results.
- The tools are fully documented.
