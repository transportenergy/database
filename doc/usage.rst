Usage
*****

The following instructions are not language-specific.
Both the Python and R tools will operate on data stored in the following way; see the language-specific sections below for more details.

1. Clone the repository and/or install the code in one or both languages.

2. Create 1 or more separate directory to contain the input and output files.
   A simple way to do this is to call ``$ item mkdirs PATH``, where ``PATH`` is a base directory; this will create a tree of directories.
   Use ``item mkdirs --help`` for more information.

3. Copy the file ``item_config_example.yaml`` to ``item_config.yaml`` in any working directory where you intend to use this code.
   Edit the file (see the inline comments) to point to the directories created in #2 above.

4. Use the tools through the :doc:`cli`.


Installation
============

Use `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_.
From source (for instance, to develop the code locally)::

    $ git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:transportenergy/database.git
    $ cd database
    $ pip install --editable .[doc,hist,tests]

Or, without cloning the repository::

    $ pip install --editable git://github.com/transportenergy/database#egg=item@subdirectory=python


Usage
=====

From Python scripts::

    import item

    data = item.load_model_data(1)


Run tests
=========

Tests in ``item/tests`` can be run with `py.test <https://pytest.org/>`_.
The command-line option ``--local-data`` must be defined in order for these tests to work::

    $ py.test --local-data=../../data/model/database item
    ================ test session starts ================
    â€¦


.. _usage-cite:

Cite the data or code
=====================

If you use or reference data from either iTEM database, or use the code, in preparation of any scientific publication, please cite the appropriate reference.

- Automatically-generated DOIs via Zenodo, either:

  - `10.5281/zenodo.4271788 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4271788>`_, which represents *all versions* of the software, and always resolves to the latest version, or
  - the DOI for a *specific version*. For instance, `10.5281/zenodo.4271789 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4271789>`_ is the DOI for :mod:`item` version 2020.11.13.

- DOI `10.5281/zenodo.4121180 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4121180>`_ for the 2020-04-15 version of the historical database, which includes a snapshot of the data and a PDF document describing some of the data cleaning steps.

The Zenodo pages provide downloadable citations in BibTeX and many other formats, for use in the reference management software of your choice.
